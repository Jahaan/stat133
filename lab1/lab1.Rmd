## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r lab1}

# variables
phone <- 80
transportation <- 20
groceries <- 527
gym <- 10
rent <- 1500
other <- 83

# total expenses
total <- phone + transportation + groceries + gym + rent + other

# semester expenses
semester <- total * 5

# year expenses
year <- semester * 2

# your vector expenses
expenses = c(phone, transportation, groceries, gym, rent, other)
barplot(expenses)

decreasing_vector = sort(expenses, decreasing = TRUE)
barplot(decreasing_vector, names.arg = c("phone", "transp.", "groc.", "gym", "rent", "other"))
